Automated test case curation: Running annotations on traces are critical for test case curation, helping track regressions and improvements, and the development of automatic evaluations.\n","3. Side-by-side comparison: Langsmith allows users to view different versions of their applications side-by-side within each chart, making it easier to compare performance during A/B testing.\n","4. Automations: This feature enables users to perform actions on traces in near real-time, such as automatically scoring traces, sending them to annotation queues, or exporting them to datasets.\n","5. Uploading and running test cases: Langsmith makes it easy to upload, create, or export test cases in bulk or on-the-fly. It also supports custom evaluations, both LLM and heuristic-based, for scoring test results.\n","6. Comparison view: When prototyping and making changes to applications, it's essential to evaluate whether they have regressed or not with respect to initial test cases. Langsmith's comparison view allows users to check this with ease.\n","\n","These features collectively help developers create, execute, and evaluate tests effectively, ensuring that LLM applications meet desired performance levels and maintain consistently high quality."]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# prompt: openai\n","\n","!pip install openai\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"a0LEShYHZbP6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717892955376,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":10302,"user":{"displayName":"Rifat RzN","userId":"09525507238813107663"}},"outputId":"7ff244c0-4128-4a1d-f2c0-eb5d825e8553"},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting openai\n","  Downloading openai-1.33.0-py3-none-any.whl (325 kB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m325.5/325.5 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m2.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: anyio<5,>=3.5.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from openai) (3.7.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: distro<2,>=1.7.0 in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (from openai) (1.7.0)\n","Collecting httpx<1,>=0.23.0 (from openai)\n","  Downloading httpx-0.27.0-py3-none-any.whl (75 kB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m75.6/75.6 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m9.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: pydantic<3,>=1.9.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from openai) (2.7.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: sniffio in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from openai) (1.3.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: tqdm>4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from openai) (4.66.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions<5,>=4.7 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from openai) (4.12.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna>=2.8 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from anyio<5,>=3.5.0->openai) (3.7)\n","Requirement already satisfied: exceptiongroup in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from anyio<5,>=3.5.0->openai) (1.2.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from httpx<1,>=0.23.0->openai) (2024.6.2)\n","Collecting httpcore==1.* (from httpx<1,>=0.23.0->openai)\n","  Downloading httpcore-1.0.5-py3-none-any.whl (77 kB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m77.9/77.9 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m9.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hCollecting h11<0.15,>=0.13 (from httpcore==1.*->httpx<1,>=0.23.0->openai)\n","  Downloading h11-0.14.0-py3-none-any.whl (58 kB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m58.3/58.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m7.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: annotated-types>=0.4.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from pydantic<3,>=1.9.0->openai) (0.7.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pydantic-core==2.18.4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from pydantic<3,>=1.9.0->openai) (2.18.4)\n","Installing collected packages: h11, httpcore, httpx, openai\n","Successfully installed h11-0.14.0 httpcore-1.0.5 httpx-0.27.0 openai-1.33.0\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from openai import OpenAI\n","\n","client = OpenAI(\n","  base_url = \"https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1\",\n","  api_key = \"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\"\n",")\n","\n","completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n","  model=\"meta/llama3-8b-instruct\",\n","  messages=[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Provide an essay of Machine Learning and Gen AI\"}],\n","  temperature=0.5,\n","  top_p=1,\n","  max_tokens=1024,\n","  stream=True\n",")\n","\n","for chunk in completion:\n","  if chunk.choices[0].delta.content is not None:\n","    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end=\"\")\n","\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"edhUNkpqYE-y","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717893461522,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":5076,"user":{"displayName":"Rifat RzN","userId":"09525507238813107663"}},"outputId":"d90859c6-7372-4c8d-ea84-025e534d6d4f"},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["**The Convergence of Machine Learning and General Artificial Intelligence: Unlocking the Future of Human-Machine Collaboration**\n","\n","The intersection of machine learning (ML) and general artificial intelligence (Gen AI) has given rise to a new era of human-machine collaboration, revolutionizing the way we live, work, and interact with each other.
